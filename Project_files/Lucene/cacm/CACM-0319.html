the

of
iteration
formulas
obtainable
by
rational
approximations

eulers
formula

derived

the

some
historical
notes
on
iterative
procedures
are
followed
by
a
derivation
of
eulers
formula
with
the
associated
error
estimate
in
a
new
notation
which
simplifies
the
error
estimate
and
suggests
generalizations
to
the
euler
polynomial
and
shows
how
a
number
of
known
formulas
may
be
derived
from
this
unified
approach
