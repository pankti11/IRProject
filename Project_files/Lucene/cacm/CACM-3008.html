preserving
average
proximity
in
arrays
programmers
and
data
structure
designers
are
often
forced
to
choose
between
alternative
structures
or
proximity
is
usually
an
important
consideration
kinds
of
list
structures
is
examined
embeddings
of
graphs
are
used
to
model
the
loss
of
proximity
involved
in
such
storage
schemes
and
an
elementary
proof
that
arrays
cannot
be
stored
as
linear
lists
with
bounded
loss
of
proximity
is
presented
average
loss
of
proximity
is
then
considered
and
it
is
shown
that
arrays
cannot
be
stored
as
linear
lists
with
only
bounded
loss
of
average
proximity
but
can
be
so
stored
in
binary
trees
the
former
result
implies
for
instance
that
row
major
order
is
an
asymptotically
optimal
storage
strategy
for
arrays
