computation
of
algebraic
properties
of
elementary
particle
reactions
using
a
digital
computer
a
large
number
of
calculations
in
high-energy
elementary
particle
physics
involve
the
manipulation
of
complicated
algebraic
expressions
containing
both
tensor
and
noncommutative
matrix
quantities
many
of
these
calculations
take
several
months
to
complete
although
the
operations
involved
follow
straightforward
rules
in
this
paper
a
program
is
described
which
has
been
developed
in
lisp
for
solving
such
problems
outlined
and
their
representation
in
the
computer
discussed
at
present
about
six
months
of
human
work
takes
less
than
fifteen
