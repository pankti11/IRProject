introduction
and
theory
in
order
to
exploit
fully
a
fast
computer
which
possesses
simultaneous
processing
abilities
it
should
to
a
large
extent
schedule
its
own
workload
rapid
execution
if
it
is
not
to
prove
self-defeating
which
programs
are
to
be
run
concurrently
and
which
sequentially
with
respect
to
each
other
a
concise
scheduling
algorithm
is
described
which
tends
to
minimize
the
time
for
executing
the
entire
pending
workload
such
as
precedence
urgency
etc
the
algorithm
is
applicable
to
a
wide
class
of
machines
