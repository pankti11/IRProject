design
of
computer
simulation
experiments
for
industrial
systems
the
aim
of
this
paper
is
to
provide
background
information
on
the
existing
literature
on
experimental
design
techniques
which
may
be
applicable
to
the
design
of
computer
simulation
experiments
for
industrial
systems
although
major
emphasis
is
placed
on
analysis
of
variance
techniques
three
other
techniques
of
data
analysis
are
considered-multiple
ranking
procedures
sequential
sampling
and
spectral
analysis
problems
and
several
techniques
for
solving
them
problem
of
stochastic
convergence
2
the
problem
of
factor
selection
3
the
problem
of
motive
and
4
the
many
response
problem
