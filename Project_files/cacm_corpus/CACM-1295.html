pert
time
calculations
without
topological
ordering
a
simplified
technique
is
presented
for
pert
time
calculations
without
topological
ordering
is
represented
by
a
link
a
link
is
defined
as
a
memory
location
containing
the
address
of
another
memory
location
the
time
information
for
an
activity
is
carried
with
its
link
for
a
typical
net
the
majority
of
activities
can
be
described
by
one
36-bit
cell
each
the
remainder
use
two
36-bit
cells
each
the
links
are
unidirectional
forward
during
the
t
e
calculation
expected
completion
time
for
an
activity
backward
during
the
t
l
calculation
the
calculations
progress
through
the
net
topologically
even
though
the
net
is
not
represented
topologically
in
core
