the
rule
mask
technique
is
one
method
of
converting
limited
entry
decision
tables
to
computer
programs
recent
discussion
suggest
that
in
many
circumstances
it
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
technique
of
constructing
networks
or
trees
a
drawback
of
the
technique
as
hitherto
presented
is
its
liability
to
produce
object
programs
of
longer
run
time
than
necessary
is
discussed
which
takes
into
account
both
rule
frequencies
and
the
relative
times
for
evaluating
conditions
