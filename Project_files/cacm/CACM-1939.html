the
problem
of
producing
sentences
of
a
transformational
grammar
by
using
a
random
generator
to
create
phrase
structure
trees
for
input
to
the
lexical
insertion
and
transformational
phases
is
discussed
which
will
be
blocked
by
the
transformations
and
which
are
frequently
too
long
to
be
of
practical
interest
program
which
allows
the
user
to
constrain
and
direct
the
generation
by
the
simple
but
powerful
device
of
restricted
subtrees
the
program
is
a
directed
random
generator
which
accepts
as
input
a
subtree
with
restrictions
and
produces
around
it
a
tree
which
satisfies
the
restrictions
and
is
ready
for
the
next
phase
of
the
grammar
the
underlying
linguistic
model
is
that

in
aspects
of
the

the
program
is
written
in
fortran

for
