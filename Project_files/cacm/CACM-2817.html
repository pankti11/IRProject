the

in
database
systems
users
access
shared
data
under
the
assumption
that
the
data
satisfies
certain
consistency
constraints
this
paper
defines
the
concepts
of
transaction
consistency
and
schedule
and
shows
that
consistency
requires
that
a
transaction
cannot
request
new
locks
after
releasing
a
lock
rather
than
a
physical
subset
of
the
database
implementation
of
predicate
locks
which
satisfies
the
consistency
condition
is
suggested
