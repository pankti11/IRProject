dynamic
computation
of
derivatives
it
is
shown
how
wengerts
procedure
for
computation
of
derivatives
can
be
implemented
conveniently
by
use
of
compiler-generated
complex
addition
subtraction
and
linkage
to
complex
arithmetic
subroutines
parallel
as
in
wengerts
procedure
but
with
the
the
values
of
the
derivatives
of
the
real
parts
derivatives
of
a
function
without
the
need
for
deriving
and
programming
the
evaluation
of
explicit
formulas
for
the
derivatives
