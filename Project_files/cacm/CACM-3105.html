access
controlled
sharing
of
information
is
needed

for

this
paper
shows
how
to
extend
programming
languages
to
provide
controlled
sharing
the
extension
permits
expression
of
access
constraints
on
shared
data
to
objects
that
are
components
of
larger
objects
such
as
bank
account
records
in
a
banks
data
base
be
enforced
by
static
checking
similar
to
type
checking
language
but
is
particularly
suitable
for
extending
languages
that
support
the
notion
of
abstract
